            <h3>Trainee Web Developer</h3>
            <p>
                I have learnt basic HTML and CSS. This website is made by basic HTML and CSS only. 
                My next target is to learn bootstrap and make website responsive. To know more about me, 
                you can visit my LinkedIn account.

                This quote is one of my favourites. I don't remember who actually told me that. 
                But this is one of those lines which have a special place in my heart. 
                My goal is to be that much able so that I can make a website however I want. 
                You can also add me on Facebook to get in touch.

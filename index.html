                I have learnt basic HTML and CSS. This website is made by basic HTML and CSS only. 
                My next target is to learn bootstrap and make website responsive. To know more about me, 
                you can visit my LinkedIn account.

                This quote is one of my favourites. I don't remember who actually told me that. 
                But this is one of those lines which have a special place in my heart. 
                My goal is to be that much able so that I can make a website however I want. 
                You can also add me on Facebook to get in touch.

                I was in operations team at NSU ACM Student Chapter. One 
                of our biggest event is Technovation. And I was one of 
                the organizers of Technovation 2.0 back in 2019. It was 
                a great experience working with a team and managing stuffs.

            <h3 class="highlight-orange">OVERWATCH  |  PUBG</h3>
            <p>
            I have been playing games since I was born. One of my hobby 
            and passion is playing video games. I have participated in 
            a lot of competitions and won maximum of those. Playing games 
            refreshes my mind and removes the "Bore" word from my life 
            completely.
